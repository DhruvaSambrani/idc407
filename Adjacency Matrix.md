# Adjacency Matrix

For a [[Appendix of words#graphs\|graph]] with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, we can define the graph using an adjacency matrix -

$$A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
   1 & \text{if there is an edge } j \to i\\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

A [[Appendix of words#multiedge\|multiedge]] can be represented by its multiplicity.

For an [[Appendix of words#undirected-graph]], the matrix is symmetric. Self edges are set to 2 by convention as formulae work out more cleanly.

For [[Appendix of words#Weighted-Networks]], edge weights are set in the adjacency matrix.
