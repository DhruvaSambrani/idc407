# Graphs

A collection of [[Appendix of words#Nodes]] and [[Appendix of words#Edges]] between nodes which may be dynamical.

## Undirected graph

A graph where $i\to j\iff j\to i$

## Weighted graphs

A graph where edges are weighted by some quantity. weights are generally positive, but can also be negative to represent a negative interactions.

Weights can also be categorical

## Acyclic Networks

Networks with no [[Appendix of words#cycle]] in them.

There exists maximally 1 path between any two nodes on an [[#Undirected graph\|undirected]]cyclic graph, for if there were two, then we can take $p_1 \circ (p_2)^\dagger$ to reach the first node, which is a cycle.

An acyclic network can be drawn such that all edges point downward. This can be shown by construction.

### Lemma 1 

There must be atleast one node which has no outgoing [[Appendix of words#edges]]. 

Proof by condradiction: we can create an infinite [[Appendix of words#Path]] since every node has atleast one outgoing edge(assumed). But there are only finite nodes. Hence, atleast one node must be repeated, which implies that there exists a subpath which is a [[Appendix of words#Cycle]]. This is a contradiction

### Construction of ordered Acyclic Graphs

1. Pick all the nodes which have no outgoing edges, place them in the lowest level
2. Since removing nodes from an acyclic network must leave it acyclic, we can repeat step 1 but put these points in the next level.
3. We repeat until all points are placed.

Clearly all edges are downward pointing

This construction also gives us a method to prove acyclicity and find cyclic subgraphs. A cycle has all points having outgoing edges by definition. Thus, at no iteration these points will ever be removed, because until one is removed, all nodes have an outgoing edge.

### Trees

These are [[Appendix of words#connected]] undirected [[#Acyclic Networks]]. 

1. There exists one and only one path between any two nodes as they have to be acyclic and connected.
2. There are exactly $n-1$ edges between $n$ nodes. We need exactly 1 edge to connect an extra node to an already existing tree to retain it's tree-ness. Since the smallest tree of just one node has 0 edges, adding $n-1$ nodes need exactly $n-1$ edges.
3. They are [[#Planar networks]]

## Hyper graphs

Graphs with generalized [[Appendix of words#edges]] which connect more than 2 nodes.

## Bipartite Graphs

Graphs with two kinds of nodes, such that edges only exist between nodes of different types.

The adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph can be made rectangular anti-diagonal, that is, its block diagonally 0.

### Incidence Matrix

The incidence matrix is a map between nodes of different types. We can put the nodes of type one as rows and the other as columns. Then, $B_ij =1$ if nodes are connected and $0$ otherwise.

### Projections

Bipartite graphs can be simplified at the cost of information loss. Nodes of one type can be kept and the others removed by making edges between nodes that share a group.

This is equivalent of taking an "OR" along one of the dimensions of the incidence matrix.
More accurately, 

$$P = BB^T$$

is the adjacency matrix of the projection. $P_{ii}$ is the number of groups node $i$ is connected to, but this can be set to 0 if necessary.

## Multiplex and Multilayer networks

Multiplex networks are those which have different kinds of edges between the same nodes. For this, we can basically consider them to be different networks and each edge type has an adjacency matrix.

Multilayer Networks are where there are nodes with different kinds which have interlayer and intralayer edges. For these, we can represent them by adjacency matrices for intralayer networks and incidence matrices of each pair of the internetworks which are pairwise bijective. These are the most general form of networks

## Planar networks

Networks which can be drawn on a plane without intersecting edges are called planar.

All [[#Trees]] are planar.

### Kuratowskiâ€™s theorem

Every non-planar network must contain an expansion of either the $K_5$ or the $UG$ subgraphs.
